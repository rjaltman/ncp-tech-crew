<!-- Hello silly doges. 

This is a comment. Open them with a less than symbol, exclamation point, and two dashes. Close it with two dashes and a greater than symbol

Remember to try and implement an efficient indentation paradigm...it helps a lot.

Recommended: Use Sublime Text as your editor for this project...it's really quite nice and is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
