The Northside Tech Crew Website Project

NCP Tech Crew website that serves three purposes: to allow members of the Northside community to submit technology problems to us, to expand knowledge of NCP Tech Crew, and to allow those in Tech Crew to learn about new web technologies.

You can make as many branches as you want, though let your collaborators know when you want to merge on certain branches that multiple people work on (<b>especially if on master!</b>). If you don't know what this stuff is about, read up on Git Repositories and GitHub (spoiler: it's awesome).
